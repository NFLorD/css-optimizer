# css-optimizer

Small utility I made, that allows the user to filter out unused CSS from stylesheets based on one or multiple HTML sources.

It's built upon these npm packages :
 - [htmlparser2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmlparser2)
 - [css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css)
 - [css-select](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-select)
